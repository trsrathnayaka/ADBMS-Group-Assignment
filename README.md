Ananda Food City POS System Using PHP and MYSQL &amp; R Studio

# Introduction 🌱
Ananda Food City has an extensive history spanning several decades, providing an extensive
variety of food items and other consumer goods to its customers. A more complicated and robust
POS system has become required as the company has grown. The current POS systems are
functional, but they have issues with data management, scalability, and real-time sales and
inventory information.
